  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>
    I have recently graduated Year 12 from Melbourne Grammar School with an ATAR of 99.25.
  <p>

  <p>
    Through the year I was also the Vice Captain of School, participated in a myriad of academic and co-curricular leadership, competed in several academic and artist competitions, while maintaining an ongoing passions for my own personal and social interests. Through experiencing a range of teachers, and with my own father a VCE English teacher of 20+ years, I have come to understand that student success is fundamentally dependant on a strong support system that allows the individual to pursue excellence. 
  <p>

  <p>
    Fresh out of the VCE system, I know what it takes to produce, ambitious, driven, and academically inspired students, that ultimately go on to produce the best results. I do not believe in providing the resources for the student to simply get by without a struggle, but rather fostering the hunger and enabling the individual to strive for incredible results. Once the correct mentality is established I offer the guidance necessary to manifest efficient and tangible study that is rewarding both quantitative and intellectual outcomes.

  <h3>Academic Mentality</h3>
  <p>
    I believe fostering a profound sense of ambition, in conjunction with a genuine care and passion for learning and for the development of the student as a human being. Study should not be about mindless pushing and a gamble on results. I offer insight into how to turn study into a wholehearted activity that is engaging, fulfilling, and rewarding on a personal level. 
  <p>

  <p>
Many tutoring companies, I have found, do not actually offer individual student support, and simply supply extra resources that can only push the student so far. I do not plan to place extra, unnecessary burdens on students’ shoulders. Rather, I aim to offer strategy and extension that empowers the student to confidently and proudly execute to the best of their true ability.
